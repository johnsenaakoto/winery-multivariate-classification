# winery-multivariate-classification
In thos notebook, I am going to classify wines using 13 features. There are 178 wines with corresponding 13 features. We are going to classify each wine based on which winery it was made from. There are 3 wineries/classes/label. I will divide this into a training set of 130 points and a test set of 48 points.
